# Notations for carnatic compositions

Each compisition is typeset as an individual document <br/>
Space added between lines to allow for notetaking <br/>

## Convention: <br/>

Lowercase letters are one note: s <br/>
Uppercase letters are two notes: S = ss <br/>
A comma extends the preceding note by one note: S, = sss <br/>
A semicolon extends the preceding note by two notes: S; = ssss <br/>
Dot over the letter is higher octave: &#7777; <br/>
Dot under the letter is lower octave: &#7751; <br/>
Underlined notes are double speed: <ins>R</ins> = r <br/>
Saahityam is written below the notes for each line. <br/>
Use of - in saahityam implies the syllable extends to cover further notes <br/>
